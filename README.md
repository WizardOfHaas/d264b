d264b - Built using Dreckig OS technology

A completely new operating system based off my Megalithic kernel archetecture.
For userspace programs d264b will use an interpreted lisp dialect.

To make a d264b boot drive simply build the kernel with make, then copy kernel64.sys onto a pure64 bootdisk image.
